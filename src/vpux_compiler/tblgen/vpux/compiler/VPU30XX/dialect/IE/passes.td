        Purpose:
        This pass replaces `Bilinear Interpolate` for which tiling is required to fit in CMX
        with sequences of operation that can be mapped on DPU and DMA.

        How it works:
        The supported interpolation axis currently supported are H and W.
        For each of these axis the scaling is happening individually, first perform vertical scaling and after perform horizontal scaling.
        On each axis the processing is split in three main regions BEGIN, MIDDLE and END.
        These three regions refers to slices from the output tensor and are influenced by the coordinate transformation mode attribute.
        * BEGIN - refers to the slice from output for which it is only needed to duplicate the first line/column from input
        * MIDDLE - refers to the slice from output where:
                    * for each output line/column from the output it is required to take two consecutive lines/colums from the input
                    * based on the coordinate transformation mode attribute compute the weight coefficients each of two lines/columns
                      has on theresulting output line/column
                    * each output line/column is computed with a GroupConvolution operation for which the weights are obtained by expanding
                     the weight coefficients of the input lines/columns
        * END - refers to the slice from output for which it is only needed to duplicate the last line/column from input
        ```
        Vertical scaling:                    Horizontal scaling
