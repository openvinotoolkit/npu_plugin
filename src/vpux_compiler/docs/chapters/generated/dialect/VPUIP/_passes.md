### `-compress-weights`: Compress binary data when possible
This pass applies bitcompactor to tensor binary data. The logic is the following:
1. Find VPUIP::NNDMAOp with Const::DeclareOp source and VPURT::DeclareBufferOp target.
2. Check that weights size matches minimal compression size.
3. Compress weights.
4. Wrap compressed weights to flat tensor shapes with UInt8 data type.
5. Replace original VPUIP::NNDMAOp with VPUIP::CompressedDMAOp
### `-dump-statistics-of-task-ops`: Dump the statistics of used Task operations
This pass dumps the statistics of used Task operations and makes a report as warning for operations not converted to DPU.
### `-group-profiling-buffers`: Group profiling buffers into single profiling output buffer
Group profiling buffers from different profiling engines into single profiling output buffer with name as
[offset]_[profiling name]_[offset]_[profiling name] so postprocessing tool can parse it back
### `-upa-profiling`: upa task profiling
This pass allocate required memory in DDR space for UPA profiling and is own profiling output to the network
